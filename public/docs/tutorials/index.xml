      <guid>https://cjyabraham.github.io/docs/tutorials/async/helloasync-cpp/</guid>
      <description>This tutorial shows you how to write a simple server and client in C++ using gRPC&amp;rsquo;s asynchronous/non-blocking APIs. It assumes you are already familiar with writing simple synchronous gRPC code, as described in gRPC Basics: C++. The example used in this tutorial follows on from the basic Greeter example we used in the overview. You&amp;rsquo;ll find it along with installation instructions in grpc/examples/cpp/helloworld.
 Overview gRPC uses the CompletionQueue API for asynchronous operations.</description>

      <title>OAuth2 on gRPC - Objective-C</title>
      <link>https://cjyabraham.github.io/docs/tutorials/auth/oauth2-objective-c/</link>

      <guid>https://cjyabraham.github.io/docs/tutorials/auth/oauth2-objective-c/</guid>
      <description>This example demonstrates how to use OAuth2 on gRPC to make authenticated API calls on behalf of a user.
By walking through it you&amp;rsquo;ll also learn how to use the Objective-C gRPC API to:
 Initialize and configure a remote call object before the RPC is started. Set request metadata elements on a call, which are semantically equivalent to HTTP request headers. Read response metadata from a call, which is equivalent to HTTP response headers and trailers.</description>
