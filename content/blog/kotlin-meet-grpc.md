As developers work to modernize applications, they need foundational tools that
are simple and scalable. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source, universal RPC
framework originally developed at Google that developers are adopting in
tremendous numbers, helping them connect services more easily and reliably.
Paired with [Kotlin][], the second most popular JVM-based programming language
in the world, developers can build everything from mobile apps to cloud
microservices. To help, we've open-sourced [gRPC Kotlin][] for the JVM, allowing
you to use gRPC with your Kotlin projects.

For the full announcement, including how to deploy gRPC Kotlin services on
[Cloud Run][], see the Google Cloud blog, [Kotlin, meet gRPC: a new open-source
project for modern apps][blog].
