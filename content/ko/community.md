## Join the gRPC Ecosystem

We have an organization for all valuable projects around gRPC in the [gRPC Ecosystem](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem). The goal is to have all projects around gRPC (showing integrations with other projects or building utilities on top of gRPC) to be showcased here. If you have a new project you would like to add to gRPC Ecosystem, please fill up the [gRPC Ecosystem Project Request](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/119zb79XRovQYafE9XKjz9sstwynCWcMpoJwHgZJvK74/edit) form.

## Gitter Channel

Join other developers and users on the [gRPC Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/grpc/grpc).

## Reddit

Join the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/grpc/).

## Community meetings

We hold a community video conference every other week. It's a way to discuss the status of work and show off things the community is working on. Meeting information and notes can be found at [bit.ly/grpcmeetings](https://bit.ly/grpcmeetings).
