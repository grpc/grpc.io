If you have ever wanted to run an event around [gRPC](/), but didn't know where to start, or weren't sure what content is available - we have released the [gRPC Meetup Kit](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/meetup-kit)!

The meetup kit includes a 15 minute presentation on the basic concepts of gRPC, with accompanying [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dgI09a-_4dwBMLyqfwchvS6iXtbcISQPLAXL6gSYOcc/edit?usp=sharing) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVsIfSfS6I4) for either reference or playback, as well as a [45-minute codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-grpc/index.html) that takes you through the basics of gRPC in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Go](https://golang.org). At the end of the codelab participants will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of gRPC.

If you are thinking about running a gRPC event, make sure to contact us to receive [gRPC stickers](https://goo.gl/forms/C3TCtFdobz4ippty2) and/or organise [office hours over Hangouts with the gRPC team](https://goo.gl/forms/pvxNwWExr5ApbNst2)!
