## Join the conversation

The [grpc-io][] forum, mentioned above, is a great place to ask technical
questions and engage in discussions with other gRPC developers.

The following channels, though less actively monitored, are also good places to
exchange with developers and find answers to your gRPC questions:

## Contribute

### gRPC code and documentation

Interested in contributing to gRPC code or documentation found under the
[grpc][grpc-org] GitHub organization? To learn how, read
[grpc-community/CONTRIBUTING.md][] and the `CONTRIBUTING.md` page of the repo
that you'd like to contribute to.

### gRPC Ecosystem

The [gRPC Ecosystem][] is a GitHub organization that hosts community projects
related to gRPC &mdash; projects include, but are not limited to, gRPC
extensions or integrations, as well as examples that demonstrate how to use gRPC
for common or technically challenging use cases.

Do you have a gRPC-related project that's a good candidate for the ecosystem?
Submit a request to have your project added; for details, see [gRPC Ecosystem -
New projects are welcome!][grpc-ecosystem-request].
