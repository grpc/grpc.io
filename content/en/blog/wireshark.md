[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org) is an open source network protocol
analyzer that can be used for protocol development, network troubleshooting, and
education. Wireshark lets you analyze gRPC messages that are transferred over
the network, and learn about the binary format of these messages.

In this post, you'll learn how to configure and use the Wireshark [gRPC
dissector][] and the [Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) dissector][pbd], which are
protocol-specific components that allow you to analyze gRPC messages with
Wireshark.

## Features

The main features of the gRPC and Protobuf dissectors are the following:

- Support dissecting (decoding) gRPC messages serialized in the
  [protocol buffer wire format][] or as JSON

- Support dissecting gRPC messages of unary, server streaming, client streaming,
  and bidirectional streaming RPC calls

- Enhanced dissection of serialized protocol buffers data by allowing
  you to do the following:
  - Load relevant `.proto` files
  - Register your own subdissectors for protocol buffer fields of type `byte` or
    `string`

## Capturing gRPC traffic

This post focuses on the analysis of captured gRPC messages. To learn how to
store network traffic in _capture files_, see [Capturing Live Network Data][]
from the [Wireshark User’s Guide][].

{{< alert title="Note" color="info" >}}
  Currently, Wireshark can only parse **plain text** gRPC messages. While
  [Wireshark supports TLS dissection][], it requires per-session secret keys. As
  of the time of writing, the only [Go gRPC][] supports the exporting such keys.
  To learn how to export keys using Go gRPC -- and other languages as support
  becomes available -- see [How to Export TLS Master keys of gRPC][].

## Example

Let's walk through the setup necessary to analyze previously-captured messages
that were generated by a slightly extended version of the _address book_ app
used in the [Protocol Buffers tutorials][].

### Address book `.proto` files

The app's main protocol file is `addressbook.proto`:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
package tutorial;
import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 id = 2;  // Unique ID number for this person.
  string email = 3;

  enum PhoneType {
    MOBILE = 0;
    HOME = 1;
    WORK = 2;
  }

  message PhoneNumber {
    string number = 1;
    PhoneType type = 2;
  }

  repeated PhoneNumber phone = 4;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp last_updated = 5;
  bytes portrait_image = 6;
}

message AddressBook {
  repeated Person people = 1;
}
```

This file is identical to the [Protocol Buffers tutorial version][pb-ab.proto],
except for the additional `portrait_image` field.

Note the `import` statement at the top of the file, it is used to import
`Timestamp`, which is one of many [Protocol Buffers Well-Known Types][].

Our variant of the app also defines a _person-search_ service that can be used
to search for address book entries based on selected `Person` attributes. The
service is defined in `person_search_service.proto`:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
package tutorial;
import "addressbook.proto";

message PersonSearchRequest {
  repeated string name = 1;
  repeated int32 id = 2;
  repeated string phoneNumber = 3;
}

service PersonSearchService {
  rpc Search (PersonSearchRequest) returns (stream Person) {}
}
```

Because the service uses the `Person` type defined in `addressbook.proto`,
the address book `.proto` is imported at the start of the file.

### Setting protobuf search paths

Wireshark gives the most meaningful decodings when it knows about the `.proto`
files used by the apps whose messages you are analyzing.

You can tell Wireshark where to find `.proto` files by setting the **Protobuf
Search Paths** in the preferences accessible from the **Edit** menu under
**Preferences \> Protocols \> Protobuf**.

If our example app's `.proto` files are in the `d:/protos/my_proto_files` directory,
and the official Protobuf library directory is
`d:/protos/protobuf-3.4.1/include`, then add these two paths as _source
directories_ like this:

![Protobuf-search-paths dialog](/img/wireshark_protobuf_search_paths.png)

By selecting the **Load all files** option for the app's protocol directory you
enable preloading of message definitions from the `addressbook.proto` file.

### Loading a capture file

From the Wireshark [SampleCaptures page][], download the following sample gRPC
capture file created by running the app and issuing a search request:
[grpc_person_search_protobuf_with_image.pcapng][].

Load this file in Wireshark by selecting **Open** from the **File** menu.

### Setting port traffic type

The app's gRPC traffic was captured on port 50051. Before you can decode the
port's messages, you need to register the port as carrying HTTP2 traffic; do
this through the **Decode As** dialog, which you access from the **Analyze**
menu:

![Decode-as dialog](/img/wireshark_decode_as_dialog.png)

### Decoding the search request message

<!--
TODO: What are the steps that the user needs to follow before the user can see
      the decoded message as shown in the screenshot?
-->
Select the first gRPC message sent to port 50051, it corresponds to the sample's
service request message. This is how Wireshark dissects the gRPC request:

<!--
TODO: I suggest reverting to the layout of the previous image, which didn't
      show the bytes pane. Also collapsing the "Stream: DATA" would be a good idea.
-->
![Decoded search request](/img/wireshark_grpc_protobuf_search_request.png)

By examining the HTTP2 message header `path` field, you'll notice the URL to the
app's service (`/tutorial.PersonSearchService`), followed by the name of the
invoked RPC (`Search`).

The `content-type`, which is set by the gRPC library, informs Wireshark that the
HTTP2 message content is a gRPC message. By examining the decoded Protocol
Buffers message of the sample gRPC request, you can see that the search request
is for the names "Jason" and "Lily".

### Decoding the server-streamed response

<!--
TODO: What are the steps that the user needs to follow before the user can see
      the decoded message as shown in the screenshot? Is the text given below correct?

TODO: How many Person objects are returned as a response? It looks like two
      from the screenshot, and the second is selected, right?
-->
Since the `Search` RPC response is server-streaming, `Person` objects can be
returned to the client one after another.

The response port, which can differ for each RPC call, is 51035 in the sample
capture file. Select the second `Person` returned in the response stream and
Wireshark decodes it as follows:

![Decoded search response](/img/wireshark_grpc_protobuf_search_response.png)

By registering subdissectors, you can have Wireshark further decode fields of
type `byte` or `string`. For example, to learn how to register a PNG decoder for
the `portrait_image` field, see [Protobuf field subdissectors][].

## History of gRPC and Protocol Buffers support

Here is a brief annotated list of Wireshark versions as they relate to the
support of gRPC and Protocol Buffers:

- v2.6.0: first release of gRPC and Protobuf dissectors, without
  support for `.proto` files or streaming RPCs.
- v3.2.0: improved dissection of serialized protocol buffers data based on
  `.proto` files, and support of streaming RPCs.
- v3.3.0: improved and enhanced `.proto` file support, such as capture-file
  search on protocol buffer field values.
- v3.4.0: Protocol Buffers [Timestamp][] time is displayed as locale date-time
  string.
