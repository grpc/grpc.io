Hello gRPC Community!

We are excited to announce that the gRPConf 2023 schedule is now live. We have a schedule with 19 total sessions (5 keynote, 14 breakout) led by a strong group of experts that are using gRPC across a variety of applications and companies. Their experiences and expertise will provide huge value for all attendees whether you are already using gRPC or are still considering it. There will be something for everyone as the talks will span topics such as tooling, implementations, production use, and user stories. 

In addition to our lineup of speakers, this year’s conference is designed to provide plenty of time to hear from the community as well. We’ll be providing breakfast, lunch, and an evening reception to give everyone the chance to network, meet project leads, and ask questions. The feedback gathered from the larger gRPC community is incredibly valuable, so we’ve also built in time for “Birds of a Feather” discussions where we can have more targeted discussions moderated by gRPC team leaders.

You can view the entire schedule [here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/grpc-conf/program/schedule/). Early Bird Registration is also still open for $50 until September 6th. If you’re interested in joining us please [register now](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/grpc-conf/register/).

We’ll see you on September 20th!
