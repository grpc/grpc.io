**gRPConf 2023 is happening!**

[Register now for $50](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/grpc-conf/) | [Submit a Talk](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/grpc-conf/program/cfp/)

Join us at the Google Cloud Campus on September 20, 2023 for a full day of talks, demos, case studies, and code labs. Experts will discuss real-world implementations of gRPC, best practices for developers, and deep dives into specific topics. This is a must-attend event for anyone using gRPC in their applications today, and those considering gRPC for their enterprise microservices.

There will be ample time to meet project leads and key members of the gRPC ecosystem, network with peers, and ask questions. This will be a great opportunity for us to hear from members of the larger gRPC community and gain valuable feedback on the entire gRPC ecosystem.

If youâ€™re interested in speaking at gRPConf, please [submit a proposal](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/grpc-conf/program/cfp/). The deadline is July 9, 2023. Spots are still available and topics might include:

- gRPC in-production
- User Stories + Case Studies
- Implementation
- Ecosystem + Tooling
- Codelabs

Speakers who are chosen will be notified by August 1, 2023, and a full schedule announcement will follow shortly after.

Early bird registration is now open and is only $50. To register or find more information about the event, check out the event page [here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/grpc-conf/). For any other questions please contact us at [grpconf@google.com](mailto:grpconf@google.com)

We hope to see you all there!
