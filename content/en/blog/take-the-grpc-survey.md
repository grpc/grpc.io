## The gRPC Project wants your feedback!

The gRPC project is looking for feedback to improve the gRPC experience. To do this, we are running a [gRPC user survey](http://bit.ly/gRPC18survey). We invite you to participate and provide input that will help us better plan and prioritize.

## gRPC User Survey

**Who** : If you currently use gRPC, have used gRPC in the past, or have any interest in it, we would love to hear from you. 

**Where**: Please take this 15 minute survey by Friday, 24th August.

**Why**: gRPC is a broadly applicable project with a variety of use cases. We want to use [this survey](http://bit.ly/gRPC18survey) to help us understand what works well, and what needs to be fixed. 

## Spread the word!

Please help us spread the word on this survey by posting it on your social networks and sharing with your friends. Every single feedback is precious, and we would like as much of it as possible!
