Dear gRPC users,

We, the gRPC maintainers, are trying to better understand the needs of
gRPC users to help plan and prioritize future efforts. We are hoping you'd be
willing to do a short call to tell us about your developer experience with gRPC,
with observability, and with microservices â€“ about what we're getting right, but
more importantly about where things could be better.

To schedule a 30 minute session, please fill out <a name="this-short-form" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1klQIom5SnpL7czmNFI9MZHy_eNwOCHghV0e61hTzY93qWw/viewform?usp=sf_link">this short form</a>.

Also, coming to the monthly <a name="Community Meetup with Office Hours" href="https://www.meetup.com/grpcio/events">Community Meetup with Office Hours</a> is a great way to improve your gRPC proficiency and get questions answered by the maintainers.
