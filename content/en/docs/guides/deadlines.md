  Explains how deadlines can be used to effectively deal with unreliable
  backends.

### Overview

A deadline is used to specify how long a client is willing to wait for a server
to respond. This simple idea is very important in building robust distributed
systems. Clients that do not wait around unnecessarily and servers that know
when to give up processing requests will improve the resource utilization and
latency of your system.

Note that while some language APIs have the concept of a __deadline__, others
use the idea of a __timeout__. When an API asks for a deadline, you provide a
point in time which the request should not go past. A timeout is the max
duration of time that the request can take. For simplicity, we will only refer
to deadline in this document.

### Deadlines on the Client

The default deadline for a gRPC client is some very large number that would not
be appropriate to use in any real world scenario. This means you should always
set a realistic deadline in your clients. To determine the appropriate deadline
you would ideally start with an educated guess based on what you know about your
system (network latency, server processing time, etc.), validated by some load
testing.

If a server has gone past the deadline when processing a request, the client
will give up and fail the RPC with the `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` status. Note that the
client giving up on a particular RPC does not automatically mean the server will
stop processing the request. The server needs to take precautions to prevent
this from happening.

### Deadlines on the Server

A gRPC server might receive RPCs from a client with an unrealistically short
deadline that would not give the server enough time to ever respond in time.
This would result in the server just wasting valuable resources and in a worse
case scenario, crash the server. To avoid situations like these, the server
should always check the deadline provided in the request and stop processing a
request once it knows the client has stopped waiting for the response.

If a server is not able to respond in time, it should free up any resources it
was using to process the request and respond with a `CANCELLED` status.

#### Deadline Propagation

Your server might need to call another server to produce a response. In these
cases where your server also acts as a client you would want to honor the
deadline set by the original client. Instead of manually calculating how long
your server has taken and deducting that from the second request deadline, you
can let gRPC handle this for you. When making the outgoing request, gRPC is
aware of the context of the incoming request and sets the deadline
automatically.
