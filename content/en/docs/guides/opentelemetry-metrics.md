## Overview

gRPC provides support for an OpenTelemetry plugin that provides metrics that can help you -
* Troubleshoot your system
* Iterate on improving system performance
* Setup continuous monitoring and alerting.

## Background

OpenTelemetry is an observability framework to create and manage telemetry data. gRPC previously provided observability support through OpenCensus which has been [sunsetted](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2023/sunsetting-opencensus/) in the favor of OpenTelemetry.

## Instruments

The gRPC OpenTelemetry plugin accepts a [MeterProvider](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/api/#meterprovider) and depends on the [OpenTelemetry API](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/overview/#api) to create a [Meter](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/api/#get-a-meter) that identifies the gRPC library being used, for example, `grpc-c++` at version `1.57.1`. The following listed instruments are created using this meter. Users should employ the [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/overview/#sdk) to customize the views exported by OpenTelemetry.

More and more gRPC components are being instrumented for observability. Currently, we have the following components instrumented -
* Per-call (stable, on by default) : Observe RPCs themselves (for example, latency.)
  * Client Per-Call : Observe a client call
  * Client Per-Attempt : Observe attempts for a client call, since a call can have multiple attempts due to retry or hedging.
  * Server : Observe a call received at the server.
* LB Policy : Observe various load-balancing policies
  * Weighted Round Robin (experimental)
  * Pick-First (experimental)
* XdsClient (experimental)

> __**NOTE**__
> Some instruments are off by default and need to be explicitly enabled from the gRPC OpenTelemetry plugin API. Experimental metrics are always off by default. ([Reference C++ API](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/ccfc163607a15faa16aea179e0a0ea673c2353c6/include/grpcpp/ext/otel_plugin.h#L139))

### Labels/Attributes

With a recorded measurement for an instrument, gRPC might provide some additional information as attributes or labels. For example, `grpc.client.attempt.started` has the labels `grpc.method` and `grpc.target` along with each measurement that tell us the method and the target associated with the RPC attempt being observed.

> __**NOTE**__
> Some attributes are marked as optional on the instruments. These need to be explicitly enabled from the gRPC OpenTelemetry Plugin API. ([Reference C++ API](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/ccfc163607a15faa16aea179e0a0ea673c2353c6/include/grpcpp/ext/otel_plugin.h#L151))

| Name        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| grpc.method | Full gRPC method name, including package, service and method, e.g. "google.bigtable.v2.Bigtable/CheckAndMutateRow". |
| grpc.status | gRPC server status code received, e.g. "OK", "CANCELLED", "DEADLINE_EXCEEDED". |
| grpc.target | Canonicalized target URI used when creating gRPC Channel, e.g. "dns:///pubsub.googleapis.com:443", "xds:///helloworld-gke:8000". |
| grpc.lb.locality | The locality to which the traffic is being sent. |
| grpc.xds.server | For clients, indicates the target of the gRPC channel in which the XdsClient is used. For servers, will be the string "#server". |
| grpc.xds.authority | The xDS authority. The value will be "#old" for old-style non-xdstp resource names. |
| grpc.xds.cache_state |Indicates the cache state of an xDS resource ("requested", "does_not_exist", "acked", "nacked", "nacked_but_cached"). |
| grpc.xds.resource_type | xDS resource type, such as "envoy.config.listener.v3.Listener". |

## FAQ

#### Q. How do I get throughput or QPS (queries per second)?

Use a count aggregation on the latency histogram metrics - `grpc.client.attempt.duration` / `grpc.client.call.duration` (for clients) or `grpc.server.call.duration` (for servers).

#### Q. How do I get error rate for RPCs?

Error counts can be calculated by using a filter `grpc.status != OK` value on the latency histogram metrics `grpc.client.attempt.duration` / `grpc.client.call.duration` (for clients) or `grpc.server.call.duration` (for servers).
