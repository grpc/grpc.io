### Overview

Metadata is a side channel that allows clients and servers to provide
information to each other that is associated with an RPC.

gRPC metadata is a key-value pair of data that is sent with initial or final
gRPC requests or responses. It is used to provide additional information about
the call, such as authentication credentials, tracing information, or custom
headers.

gRPC metadata is implemented using HTTP/2 headers. The keys are ASCII
strings, while the values can be either ASCII strings or binary data. The keys
are case insensitive
and must not start with the prefix `grpc-`, which is reserved for gRPC itself.

gRPC metadata can be sent and received by both the client and the server.
Headers are sent from the client to the server on the initial request and from
the server to the client on the initial response of an RPC call. Similarly,
each will send trailers when half closing the RPC call.

gRPC metadata is useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

* **Authentication**: gRPC metadata can be used to send authentication
  credentials to the server.
  This can be used to implement different authentication schemes, such as `OAuth2`
  or `JWT` using the standard HTTP Authorization header.
* **Tracing**: gRPC metadata can be used to send tracing information to the
  server.
  This can be used to track the progress of a request through a distributed
  system.
* **Custom headers**: gRPC metadata can be used to send custom headers to the
  server or from the server to the client.
  This can be used to implement application-specific features, such as load
  balancing, rate limiting or providing detailed error messages from the server
  to the client.
* **Internal usages**: gRPC uses HTTP/2 headers and trailers, which will be
  integrated with the metadata specified by your application.

See [Concepts guide](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#metadata)

#### Be Aware

```
WARNING: Servers may limit the size of Request-Headers, with a default of 8 KiB suggested.
```

Custom metadata must follow the "Custom-Metadata" format listed in
[PROTOCOL-HTTP2](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md)
, with the exception of binary headers not needing to be base64 encoded.

#### Headers

Headers are sent with the initial request message from the client to the server
and with the initial response from the server to the client. The header includes
things like authentication credentials and how to handle the RPC.
Some of the headers, such as authorization, are generated by gRPC for you.

Custom header handling is language dependent, generally through interceptors.

#### Trailers

Trailers are a special kind of header that is sent after the message data. They
are used internally to communicate the outcome of an RPC. At the application
level, custom trailers can be used to communicate
values known only after the message data has been completely generated such as
digital signatures and integrity checks, or anything else the server wants to
communicate outside of the return values.
