### Overview

Metadata is a side channel that allows clients and servers to provide
information to each other that is associated with the data messages.

gRPC metadata is a key-value pair of data that is sent with a gRPC request or
response. It is used to provide additional information about the call, such as
authentication credentials, tracing information, or custom headers.

gRPC metadata is implemented using HTTP/2 headers. The keys and values are ASCII
strings, but the values can also be binary data. The keys are case insensitive
and must not start with the prefix grpc-, which is reserved for gRPC itself.

gRPC metadata can be sent and received by both the client and the server. It is
sent in the initial headers of the RPC call, and can also be sent in subsequent
trailers.

gRPC metadata is useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

* **Authentication**: gRPC metadata can be used to send authentication credentials to
the server. This can be used to implement different authentication schemes, such
as OAuth2 or JWT.
* **Tracing**: gRPC metadata can be used to send tracing information to the server.
This can be used to track the progress of a request through a distributed
system.
* **Custom headers**: gRPC metadata can be used to send custom headers to the server.
This can be used to implement application-specific features, such as load
balancing, rate limiting or providing detailed error messages from the server
to the client.
* **Internal usages**: metadata is used by gRPC to communicate how to handle an
RPC such as compression, keep-alive and other things.  It is also used to
communicate the Status of an RPC from the server to the client.

See [Concepts guide](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#metadata)

#### Be Aware
```
WARNING: Servers may limit the size of Request-Headers, with a default of 8 KiB suggested.
```

Custom metadata must follow the "Custom-Metadata" format listed in
[PROTOCOL-HTTP2](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md)
, with the exception of binary headers not needing to be base64 encoded.



#### Headers
Headers are sent before any data.  The header includes things like
authentication credentials and how to handle the RPC.  

Some of the headers, such as authorization are generated by gRPC for you.  
Custom header handling is language dependent. For example, in Java and Go they
are generally provided through Interceptors.

#### Trailers
Trailers are a special kind of header that is sent after the message data.  They
are used internally to communicate the outcome of an RPC or that an RPC has been
cancelled.  At the application level, custom trailers can be used to communicate
values known only after the message data has been completely generated such as
digital signatures and integrity checks or anything else the server wants to
communicate outside of the return values.
