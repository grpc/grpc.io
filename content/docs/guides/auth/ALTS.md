  An overview of gRPC authentication using Application Layer Transport Security
  (ALTS).

### Overview

Application Layer Transport Security (ALTS) is a mutual authentication and
transport encryption system developed by Google and used for securing RPC
communications within Google's infrastructure. ALTS is similar in concept to
mutual TLS but has been designed and optimized to meet the needs of Google's
production environments. For more information about ALTS and how it works, see
the
[ALTS whitepaper](https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption-in-transit/application-layer-transport-security).

ALTS is now available to all gRPC users, if the application runs on
[Google Compute Engine (GCE)](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) or
[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine). It
has the following features:

-   Create gRPC servers & clients with ALTS as the transport security protocol.
-   Transparent identity provisioning and key management of ALTS credentials.
-   ALTS connections are end-to-end protected with privacy and integrity.
-   Applications can access peer information such as the peer service account.
-   Client authorization and server authorization support.
-   Minimal code changes to enable ALTS.

gRPC users can configure their applications to use ALTS as a transport security
protocol with few lines of code, simply indicating the intent of using ALTS.
gRPC ALTS is supported in C++, Java, Go, and Python.

### Identity and Key Management

Using ALTS transport security protocol, the identity of the gRPC application is
the primary service account associated with the GCE VM that the application runs
on. The service account of a GCE VM can be set or changed using
[gCloud command](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/set-service-account)
or via
[GCP console](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#using).

Google issues an ALTS credential for each service account running on the GCE VM.
The ALTS credentials are securely located in the hypervisor. The private key of
an ALTS credential is not accessible to the VM and the application. The session
keys used for end-to-end encryption are exposed to the gRPC stack. Google fully
manages the ALTS credentials, including certificate issuing, certificate
rotation, and certification revocation.

### gRPC Client with ALTS Transport Security Protocol

gRPC clients can use ALTS credentials to connect to servers. The following
provides examples of how to set up such clients in all supported gRPC languages.

#### C++

```cpp
#include <grpcpp/grpcpp.h>
#include <grpcpp/security/credentials.h>

using grpc::experimental::AltsCredentials;
using grpc_impl::experimental::AltsCredentialsOptions;

auto creds = AltsCredentials(AltsCredentialsOptions());
std::shared_ptr<grpc::Channel> channel = CreateChannel(server_address, creds);
```

#### Java

```java
import io.grpc.alts.AltsChannelBuilder;
import io.grpc.ManagedChannel;

ManagedChannel managedChannel =
    AltsChannelBuilder.forTarget(serverAddress).build();
```

#### Go

```go
import (
  "google.golang.org/grpc"
  "google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/alts"
)

altsTC := alts.NewClientCreds(alts.DefaultClientOptions())
conn, err := grpc.Dial(serverAddr, grpc.WithTransportCredentials(altsTC))
```

#### Python

```python
import grpc

channel_creds = grpc.alts_channel_credentials()
channel = grpc.secure_channel(address, channel_creds)
```

### gRPC Server with ALTS Transport Security Protocol

gRPC servers can use ALTS credentials to allow clients to connect to them. The
following provides examples of how to set up such servers in all supported gRPC
languages.

#### C++

```cpp
#include <grpcpp/security/server_credentials.h>
#include <grpcpp/server.h>
#include <grpcpp/server_builder.h>

using grpc::experimental::AltsServerCredentials;
using grpc_impl::experimental::AltsServerCredentialsOptions;

grpc::ServerBuilder builder;
builder.RegisterService(&service);
auto creds = AltsServerCredentials(AltsServerCredentialsOptions());
builder.AddListeningPort("[::]:<port>", creds);
std::unique_ptr<Server> server(builder.BuildAndStart());
```

#### Java

```java
import io.grpc.alts.AltsServerBuilder;
import io.grpc.Server;

Server server = AltsServerBuilder.forPort(<port>)
    .addService(new MyServiceImpl()).build().start();

```

#### Go

```go
import (
  "google.golang.org/grpc"
  "google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/alts"
)

altsTC := alts.NewClientCreds(alts.DefaultClientOptions())
conn, err := grpc.Dial(serverAddr, grpc.WithTransportCredentials(altsTC))
```

#### Python

```python
import grpc

server = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor())
server_creds = grpc.alts_server_credentials()
server.add_secure_port(SERVER_ADDRESS, server_creds)
```

### Server Authorization

gRPC has built-in server authorization support using ALTS transport security. A
gRPC client using ALTS can set the expected service accounts prior to
establishing the ALTS connection. Then, at the end of the ALTS handshake, it is
guaranteed that the server identity must match one of the service accounts
specified by the client, otherwise the connection would fail.

#### C++

```cpp
#include <grpcpp/grpcpp.h>
#include <grpcpp/security/credentials.h>

using grpc::experimental::AltsCredentials;
using grpc_impl::experimental::AltsCredentialsOptions;

AltsCredentialsOptions opts;
opts.target_service_accounts.push_back("expected_server_service_account1");
opts.target_service_accounts.push_back("expected_server_service_account2");
auto creds = AltsCredentials(opts);
std::shared_ptr<grpc::Channel> channel = CreateChannel(server_address, creds);
```

#### Java

```java
import io.grpc.alts.AltsChannelBuilder;
import io.grpc.ManagedChannel;

ManagedChannel channel =
     AltsChannelBuilder.forTarget(serverAddress)
         .addTargetServiceAccount("expected_server_service_account1")
         .addTargetServiceAccount("expected_server_service_account2")
         .build();
```

#### Go

```go
import (
  "google.golang.org/grpc"
  "google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/alts"
)

clientOpts := alts.DefaultClientOptions()
clientOpts.TargetServiceAccounts = []string{expectedServerSA}
altsTC := alts.NewClientCreds(clientOpts)
conn, err := grpc.Dial(serverAddr, grpc.WithTransportCredentials(altsTC))
```

### Client Authorization

On a successful ALTS connection, the peer information (e.g., clientâ€™s service
account) is stored in the AltsContext. gRPC provides a utility library for
client authorization check. Assume that the server knows the expected client
identity (e.g., foo@iam.gserviceaccount.com), it can run the following example
codes to authorize the incoming RPC.

#### C++

```cpp
#include <grpcpp/server_context.h>
#include <grpcpp/security/alts_util.h>

grpc::ServerContext* context;
grpc::Status status = experimental::AltsClientAuthzCheck(
    context->auth_context(), {"foo@iam.gserviceaccount.com"});
```

#### Java

```java
import io.grpc.alts.AuthorizationUtil;
import io.grpc.ServerCall;
import io.grpc.Status;

ServerCall<?, ?> call;
Status status = AuthorizationUtil.clientAuthorizationCheck(
    call, Lists.newArrayList("foo@iam.gserviceaccount.com"));
```

#### Go

```go
import (
  "google.golang.org/grpc"
  "google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/alts"
)

err := alts.ClientAuthorizationCheck(ctx, []string{"foo@iam.gserviceaccount.com"})
```
