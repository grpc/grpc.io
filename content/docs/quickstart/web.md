description: This guide gets you started with gRPC-Web with a simple working example.

### Prerequisites

- `docker`
- `docker-compose`

This demo requires Docker Compose file
[version 3](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/). Please refer to
[Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) on how to install Docker.

### Run an Echo example from your browser!

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web
$ cd grpc-web
$ docker-compose pull
$ docker-compose up -d node-server envoy commonjs-client
```

From your browser visit
[localhost:8081/echotest.html](http://localhost:8081/echotest.html).

To shutdown, run `docker-compose down`.


### What is happening?

In this demo, there are three key components:

 1. `node-server`: This is a standard gRPC Server, implemented in Node. This
    server listens at port `:9090` and implements the service's business logic.

 2. `envoy`: This is the Envoy proxy. It listens at `:8080` and forwards the
    browser's gRPC-Web requests to port `:9090`. This is done via a config file
    `envoy.yaml`.

 3. `commonjs-client`: This component generates the client stub class using the
    `protoc-gen-grpc-web` protoc plugin, compiles all the JS dependencies using
    `webpack`, and hosts the static content `echotest.html` and `dist/main.js`
    using a simple web server at port `:8081`. Once the user interacts with the
    webpage, it sends a gRPC-Web request to the Envoy proxy endpoint at `:8080`.


### What's next

- Work through a more detailed tutorial in [gRPC Basics: Web](/docs/tutorials/basic/web/).
