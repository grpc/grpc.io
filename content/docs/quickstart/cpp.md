### Prerequisites

#### gRPC

To install gRPC on your system, follow the [instructions to install gRPC C++ via make](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/cpp/README.md#make).

To run the example code, please ensure `pkg-config` is installed on your
machine before you build and install gRPC in the previous step, since the
example `Makefile`s try to look up the installed gRPC path using `pkg-config`.
On Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, this can usually be done via
`sudo apt-get install pkg-config`.

#### Protocol Buffers v3

While not mandatory to use gRPC, gRPC applications usually leverage Protocol
Buffers v3 for service definitions and data serialization, and our example code
uses Protocol Buffers as well as gRPC. If you don't already have it installed on
your system, you can install the version cloned alongside gRPC. First ensure
that you are running these commands in the gRPC tree you just built in the from
the previous step.

```sh
$ cd third_party/protobuf
$ make && sudo make install
```

###  Build the example

Always assuming you have gRPC properly installed, go into the example's
directory:

```sh
$ cd examples/cpp/helloworld/
```

Let's build the example client and server:
```sh
$ make
```

Most failures at this point are a result of a faulty installation (or having
installed gRPC to a non-standard location. Check out [the installation
instructions for details](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/cpp/README.md#make)).

### Try it!

From the `examples/cpp/helloworld` directory, run the server, which will listen
on port 50051:

```sh
$ ./greeter_server
```

From a different terminal, run the client:

```sh
$ ./greeter_client
```

If things go smoothly, you will see the `Greeter received: Hello world` in the
client side output.

Congratulations! You've just run a client-server application with gRPC.

### Update a gRPC service

Now let's look at how to update the application with an extra method on the
server for the client to call. Our gRPC service is defined using protocol
buffers; you can find out lots more about how to define a service in a `.proto`
file in [What is gRPC?](/docs/guides/) and [gRPC Basics:
C++](/docs/tutorials/basic/cpp/). For now all you need to know is that both the server and the client
"stub" have a `SayHello` RPC method that takes a `HelloRequest` parameter from
the client and returns a `HelloResponse` from the server, and that this method
is defined like this:

```protobuf
// The greeting service definition.
service Greeter {
  // Sends a greeting
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

// The request message containing the user's name.
message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

// The response message containing the greetings
message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

Let's update this so that the `Greeter` service has two methods. Edit
`examples/protos/helloworld.proto` (from the root of the cloned repository) and
update it with a new `SayHelloAgain` method, with the same request and response
types:

```protobuf
// The greeting service definition.
service Greeter {
  // Sends a greeting
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
  // Sends another greeting
  rpc SayHelloAgain (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

// The request message containing the user's name.
message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

// The response message containing the greetings
message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

Remember to save the file!

### Generate gRPC code

Next we need to update the gRPC code used by our application to use the new
service definition. From the `examples/cpp/helloworld` directory:

```sh
$ make
```

This regenerates `helloworld.pb.{h,cc}` and `helloworld.grpc.pb.{h,cc}`, which
contains our generated client and server classes, as well as classes for
populating, serializing, and retrieving our request and response types.

### Update and run the application

We now have new generated server and client code, but we still need to implement
and call the new method in the human-written parts of our example application.

#### Update the server

In the same directory, open `greeter_server.cc`. Implement the new method like
this:

```c++
class GreeterServiceImpl final : public Greeter::Service {
  Status SayHello(ServerContext* context, const HelloRequest* request,
                  HelloReply* reply) override {
     // ... (pre-existing code)
  }

  Status SayHelloAgain(ServerContext* context, const HelloRequest* request,
                       HelloReply* reply) override {
    std::string prefix("Hello again ");
    reply->set_message(prefix + request->name());
    return Status::OK;
  }
};

```

#### Update the client

A new `SayHelloAgain` method is now available in the stub. We'll follow the same
pattern as for the already present `SayHello` and add a new `SayHelloAgain`
method to `GreeterClient`:

```c++
class GreeterClient {
 public:
  // ...
  std::string SayHello(const std::string& user) {
     // ...
  }

  std::string SayHelloAgain(const std::string& user) {
    // Follows the same pattern as SayHello.
    HelloRequest request;
    request.set_name(user);
    HelloReply reply;
    ClientContext context;

    // Here we can use the stub's newly available method we just added.
    Status status = stub_->SayHelloAgain(&context, request, &reply);
    if (status.ok()) {
      return reply.message();
    } else {
      std::cout << status.error_code() << ": " << status.error_message()
                << std::endl;
      return "RPC failed";
    }
  }

```

Finally, we exercise this new method in `main`:

```c++
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  // ...
  std::string reply = greeter.SayHello(user);
  std::cout << "Greeter received: " << reply << std::endl;

  reply = greeter.SayHelloAgain(user);
  std::cout << "Greeter received: " << reply << std::endl;

  return 0;
}

```

#### Run!

Just like we did before, from the `examples/cpp/helloworld` directory:

 1. Build the client and server after having made changes:

    ```sh
    $ make
    ```

 2. Run the server:

    ```sh
    $ ./greeter_server
    ```

 3. On a different terminal, run the client:

    ```sh
    $ ./greeter_client
    ```

    You'll see the following output:

    ```sh
    Greeter received: Hello world
    Greeter received: Hello again world
    ```
