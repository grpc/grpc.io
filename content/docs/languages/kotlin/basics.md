This tutorial provides a basic Kotlin programmer's introduction to
working with gRPC.

By walking through this example you'll learn how to:

- Define a service in a `.proto` file.
- Generate server and client code using the protocol buffer compiler.
- Use the Kotlin gRPC API to write a simple client and server for your service.

You should already be familiar gRPC and protocol buffers; if not, see
[Introduction to gRPC][] and the proto3 [Language guide][proto3].

### Why use gRPC?

{{< why-grpc >}}

### Setup

This tutorial has the same [prerequisites][] as the [Quick start][]. Install the
necessary SDKs and tools before proceeding.

### Get the example code

The example code is part of the [grpc-kotlin][] repo.

 1. [Download the repo as a zip file][download] and unzip it, or clone
    the repo:

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/grpc/grpc-kotlin
    ```

 2. Change to the examples directory:

    ```sh
    $ cd grpc-kotlin/examples
    ```

### Defining the service

Your first step (as you'll know from the [Introduction to gRPC][]) is to define
the gRPC _service_ and the method _request_ and _response_ types using [protocol
buffers][proto3].

If you'd like to follow along by looking at the complete `.proto` file, see
`routeguide/route_guide.proto` from the
[protos/src/main/proto/io/grpc/examples][protos-src] folder.

To define a service, you specify a named `service` in the `.proto` file like
this:

```proto
service RouteGuide {
   ...
}
```

Then you define `rpc` methods inside your service definition, specifying their
request and response types. gRPC lets you define four kinds of service method,
all of which are used in the `RouteGuide` service:

- A *simple RPC* where the client sends a request to the server using the stub
  and waits for a response to come back, just like a normal function call.

  ```proto
  // Obtains the feature at a given position.
  rpc GetFeature(Point) returns (Feature) {}
  ```

- A *server-side streaming RPC* where the client sends a request to the server
  and gets a stream to read a sequence of messages back. The client reads from
  the returned stream until there are no more messages. As you can see in our
  example, you specify a server-side streaming method by placing the `stream`
  keyword before the *response* type.

  ```proto
  // Obtains the Features available within the given Rectangle.  Results are
  // streamed rather than returned at once (e.g. in a response message with a
  // repeated field), as the rectangle may cover a large area and contain a
  // huge number of features.
  rpc ListFeatures(Rectangle) returns (stream Feature) {}
  ```

- A *client-side streaming RPC* where the client writes a sequence of messages
  and sends them to the server, again using a provided stream. Once the client
  has finished writing the messages, it waits for the server to read them all
  and return its response. You specify a client-side streaming method by placing
  the `stream` keyword before the *request* type.

  ```proto
  // Accepts a stream of Points on a route being traversed, returning a
  // RouteSummary when traversal is completed.
  rpc RecordRoute(stream Point) returns (RouteSummary) {}
  ```

- A *bidirectional streaming RPC* where both sides send a sequence of messages
  using a read-write stream. The two streams operate independently, so clients
  and servers can read and write in whatever order they like: for example, the
  server could wait to receive all the client messages before writing its
  responses, or it could alternately read a message then write a message, or
  some other combination of reads and writes. The order of messages in each
  stream is preserved. You specify this type of method by placing the `stream`
  keyword before both the request and the response.

  ```proto
  // Accepts a stream of RouteNotes sent while a route is being traversed,
  // while receiving other RouteNotes (e.g. from other users).
  rpc RouteChat(stream RouteNote) returns (stream RouteNote) {}
  ```

The `.proto` file also contains protocol buffer message type definitions for all
the request and response types used by the service methods -- for example, here's
the `Point` message type:

```proto
// Points are represented as latitude-longitude pairs in the E7 representation
// (degrees multiplied by 10**7 and rounded to the nearest integer).
// Latitudes should be in the range +/- 90 degrees and longitude should be in
// the range +/- 180 degrees (inclusive).
message Point {
  int32 latitude = 1;
  int32 longitude = 2;
}
```

### Generating client and server code

Next, you need to generate the gRPC client and server interfaces from the `.proto`
service definition. You do this using the protocol buffer compiler `protoc` with
special gRPC Kotlin and Java plugins.

When using Gradle or Maven, the `protoc` build plugin will generate the
necessary code as part of the build process. For a Gradle example, see
[stub/build.gradle.kts][].

If you run `./gradlew installDist` from the examples folder, the following files
are generated from the service definition -- you'll find the generated files in
subdirectories below `stub/build/generated/source/proto/main`:

- `Feature.java`, `Point.java`, `Rectangle.java`, and others, which contain all
  the protocol buffer code to populate, serialize, and retrieve our request and
  response message types.

  You'll find these files in the `java/io/grpc/examples/routeguide`
  subdirectory.
- `RouteGuideOuterClassGrpcKt.kt`, which contains, among other things:
  - `RouteGuideGrpcKt.RouteGuideCoroutineImplBase`, an abstract base class for
    `RouteGuide` servers to implement, with all the methods defined in the
    `RouteGuide` service.
  - `RouteGuideGrpcKt.RouteGuideCoroutineStub`, a class that clients use to talk
    to a `RouteGuide` server.

  You'll find this Kotlin file under `grpckt/io/grpc/examples/routeguide`.

### Creating the server {#server}

First consider how to create a `RouteGuide` server. If you're only interested in
creating gRPC clients, skip ahead to [Creating the client](#client) -- though
you might find this section interesting anyway!

There are two main things that you need to do when creating a `RouteGuide`
server:

- Extend the `RouteGuideCoroutineImplBase` service base class to do the actual
  service work.
- Create and run a gRPC server to listen for requests from clients and return
  the service responses.

Open the example `RouteGuide` server code in `routeguide/RouteGuideServer.kt`
under the [server/src/main/kotlin/io/grpc/examples][server-src] folder.

#### Implementing RouteGuide

As you can see, the server has a `RouteGuideService` class that extends the
generated service base class:

```kotlin
class RouteGuideService(
  val features: Collection<Feature>,
  /* ... */
) : RouteGuideGrpcKt.RouteGuideCoroutineImplBase() {
  /* ... */
}
```

#### Simple RPC

`RouteGuideService` implements all the service methods. Consider the simplest
method first, `GetFeature()`, which gets a `Point` from the client and returns a
`Feature` built from the corresponding feature information in the database.

```kotlin
override suspend fun getFeature(request: Point): Feature =
    features.find { it.location == request } ?:
    // No feature was found, return an unnamed feature.
    Feature.newBuilder().apply { location = request }.build()
```

The method accepts a client's `Point` message request as a parameter, and it
returns a `Feature` message as a response. The method populates the `Feature`
with the appropriate information, and then returns it to the gRPC framework,
which sends it back to the client.

##### Server-side streaming RPC

Next, consider one of the streaming RPCs. `ListFeatures()` is a server-side
streaming RPC, so the server gets to send back multiple `Feature` messages to
the client.

```kotlin
override fun listFeatures(request: Rectangle): Flow<Feature> =
  features.asFlow().filter { it.exists() && it.location in request }
```

The request object is a `Rectangle`. The server collects, and returns to the
client, all the `Feature` objects in its collection that are inside the given
`Rectangle`.

##### Client-side streaming RPC

Now consider something a little more complicated: the client-side streaming
method `RecordRoute()`, where the server gets a stream of `Point` objects from
the client, and returns a single `RouteSummary` with information about their
trip through the given points.

```kotlin
override suspend fun recordRoute(requests: Flow<Point>): RouteSummary {
  var pointCount = 0
  var featureCount = 0
  var distance = 0
  var previous: Point? = null
  val stopwatch = Stopwatch.createStarted(ticker)
  requests.collect { request ->
    pointCount++
    if (getFeature(request).exists()) {
      featureCount++
    }
    val prev = previous
    if (prev != null) {
      distance += prev distanceTo request
    }
    previous = request
  }
  return RouteSummary.newBuilder().apply {
    this.pointCount = pointCount
    this.featureCount = featureCount
    this.distance = distance
    this.elapsedTime = Durations.fromMicros(stopwatch.elapsed(TimeUnit.MICROSECONDS))
  }.build()
}
```

The request parameter is a stream of client request messages represented as a
Kotlin [Flow][]. The server returns a single response just like in the simple
RPC case.

##### Bidirectional streaming RPC

Finally, consider the bidirectional streaming RPC `RouteChat()`.

```kotlin
override fun routeChat(requests: Flow<RouteNote>): Flow<RouteNote> =
  flow {
    // could use transform, but it's currently experimental
    requests.collect { note ->
      val notes: MutableList<RouteNote> = routeNotes.computeIfAbsent(note.location) {
        Collections.synchronizedList(mutableListOf<RouteNote>())
      }
      for (prevNote in notes.toTypedArray()) { // thread-safe snapshot
        emit(prevNote)
      }
      notes += note
    }
  }
```

Similar to the client-side streaming example, for this method, the server gets a
stream of `RouteNote` objects as a `Flow`. However, this time the server returns
`RouteNote` instances via the method's returned stream _while_ the client is still
writing messages to _its_ message stream.

#### Starting the server

Once all the server's methods are implemented, you need code to create a gRPC
server instance, something like this:

```kotlin
class RouteGuideServer(
    val port: Int,
    val features: Collection<Feature> = Database.features(),
    val server: Server =
      ServerBuilder.forPort(port)
        .addService(RouteGuideService(features)).build()
) {

  fun start() {
    server.start()
    println("Server started, listening on $port")
    /* ... */
  }
  /* ... */
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  val port = 8980
  val server = RouteGuideServer(port)
  server.start()
  /* ... */
}
```

A server instance is built and started using a `ServerBuilder` as follows:

1. Specify the port, that the server will listen for client requests on, using
   `forPort()`.
1. Create an instance of the service implementation class `RouteGuideService`
   and pass it to the builder's `addService()` method.
1. Call `build()` and `start()` on the builder to create and start an RPC server
   for the route guide service.

### Creating the client {#client}

In this section, you'll look at a client for the `RouteGuide` service.

For the complete client code, open `routeguide/RouteGuideClient.kt`
under the [client/src/main/kotlin/io/grpc/examples][client-src] folder.

#### Instantiating a stub

To call service methods, you first need to create a gRPC _channel_ using a
`ManagedChannelBuilder`. You'll use this channel to communicate with the server.

```kotlin
val channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress("localhost", 8980).usePlaintext().build()
```

Once the gRPC channel is setup, you need a client _stub_ to perform RPCs. Get it
by instantiating `RouteGuideCoroutineStub`, which is available from the package
that was generated from the `.proto` file.

```kotlin
val stub = RouteGuideCoroutineStub(channel)
```

#### Calling service methods

Now consider how you'll call service methods.

##### Simple RPC

Calling the simple RPC `GetFeature()` is as straightforward as calling a local
method:

```kotlin
val request = point(latitude, longitude)
val feature = stub.getFeature(request)
```

The stub method `getFeature()` executes the corresponding RPC, suspending until
the RPC completes:

```kotlin
suspend fun getFeature(latitude: Int, longitude: Int) {
  val request = point(latitude, longitude)
  val feature = stub.getFeature(request)
  if (feature.exists()) { /* ... */ }
}
```

##### Server-side streaming RPC

Next, consider the server-side streaming `ListFeatures()` RPC, which returns a
stream of geographical features:

```kotlin
suspend fun listFeatures(lowLat: Int, lowLon: Int, hiLat: Int, hiLon: Int) {
  val request = Rectangle.newBuilder()
    .setLo(point(lowLat, lowLon))
    .setHi(point(hiLat, hiLon))
    .build()
  var i = 1
  stub.listFeatures(request).collect { feature ->
    println("Result #${i++}: $feature")
  }
}
```

The stub `listFeatures()` method returns a stream of features in the form of a
`Flow<Feature>` instance. The flow `collect()` method allows the client to
processes the server-provided features as they become available.

##### Client-side streaming RPC

The client-side streaming `RecordRoute()` RPC sends a stream of `Point` messages
to the server and gets back a single `RouteSummary`.

```kotlin
suspend fun recordRoute(points: Flow<Point>) {
  println("*** RecordRoute")
  val summary = stub.recordRoute(points)
  println("Finished trip with ${summary.pointCount} points.")
  println("Passed ${summary.featureCount} features.")
  println("Travelled ${summary.distance} meters.")
  val duration = summary.elapsedTime.seconds
  println("It took $duration seconds.")
}
```

The method generates the route points from the points associated with a randomly
selected list of features. The random selection is taken from a previously
loaded feature collection:

```kotlin
fun generateRoutePoints(features: List<Feature>, numPoints: Int): Flow<Point> = flow {
  for (i in 1..numPoints) {
    val feature = features.random(random)
    println("Visiting point ${feature.location.toStr()}")
    emit(feature.location)
    delay(timeMillis = random.nextLong(500L..1500L))
  }
}
```

Note that flow points are emitted lazily, that is, only once the server requests
them. Once a point has been emitted to the flow, the point generator suspends
until the server requests the next point.

##### Bidirectional streaming RPC

Finally, consider the bidirectional streaming RPC `RouteChat()`. As in the case
of `RecordRoute()`, you pass to the stub method a stream that you use to write
the request messages to; like in `ListFeatures()`, you get back a stream that
you can use to read response messages from. However, this time you send values
via our method's stream while the server is also writing messages to _its_
message stream.

```kotlin
suspend fun routeChat() {
  val requests = generateOutgoingNotes()
  stub.routeChat(requests).collect { note ->
    println("Got message \"${note.message}\" at ${note.location.toStr()}")
  }
  println("Finished RouteChat")
}

private fun generateOutgoingNotes(): Flow<RouteNote> = flow {
  val notes = listOf(/* ... */)
  for (note in notes) {
    println("Sending message \"${note.message}\" at ${note.location.toStr()}")
    emit(note)
    delay(500)
  }
}
```

The syntax for reading and writing here is very similar to the client-side and
server-side streaming methods. Although each side will always get the other's
messages in the order they were written, both the client and server can read and
write in any order —- the streams operate completely independently.

### Try it out!

Run the following commands from the `grpc-kotlin/examples` directory:

 1. Compile the client and server

    ```sh
    $ ./gradlew installDist
    ```

 2. Run the server:

    ```sh
    $ ./server/build/install/server/bin/route-guide-server
    Server started, listening on 8980
    ```

 3. From another terminal, run the client:

    ```sh
    $ ./client/build/install/client/bin/route-guide-client
    ```

You'll see client output like this:

```nocode
