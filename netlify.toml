1. Create or open the `netlify.toml` file at the root of your project.
2. Add a `[[rewrites]]` rule.

```toml  theme={null}
# netlify.toml

[[rewrites]]
  from = "/help/*"
  to = "https://chatbase.co/{agentId}/help/:splat"
  status = 200 # A 200 status indicates a rewrite, not a redirect

[[rewrites]]
  from = "/help"
  to = "https://chatbase.co/{agentId}/help"
  status = 200
```

Commit and push this file to your repository, and Netlify will apply the rule on the next build.
